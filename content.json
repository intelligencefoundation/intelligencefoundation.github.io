Do it flamboyantly. No exceptions.». – William James In 1993, Vincent Boucher took only 29 minutes to win, with the first 100 % score ever, the Ordre des chimiste du Québec competition.

Theoretical Physics in 1 year (suite de l’article), followed by a Master’s degree in Government Policy Analysis (1998) and a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering (2000).
